# Workshop 02 - Copy and Move Semantics

In this workshop, we compared move and copy operations on an object that contains a dynamically allocated array of strings objects.

w2.cpp & gutenberg_shakespeare were provided to us to test our program.

`./w2 gutenberg_shakespeare` to test.

My intention with uploading this code on GitHub is merely to build a portfilo of my work.
If you are another Seneca student please do not copy my work.
